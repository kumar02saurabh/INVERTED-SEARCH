An inverted index is a data structure that maps words or numbers to their locations in documents or databases, enabling fast and efficient text searches. Unlike forward indexing, it utilizes hashing algorithms to optimize performance, making lookups significantly faster.

📌 Features
✔️ Stores a sorted list of words for quick lookup
✔️ Supports efficient indexing and querying
✔️ Uses hashing for optimized word-to-location mapping
✔️ Implements a single linked list for dynamic word storage
✔️ File handling for reading/writing indexed data

⚡ Requirements
Indexing: Build and maintain the inverted index

Querying: Retrieve document locations based on search terms

🛠️ Pre-requisites
🔹 Hashing – Efficient word mapping
🔹 Single Linked List – Managing indexed words
🔹 File Handling – Storing and retrieving index data
